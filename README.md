# Augmental Reality Frame

  

Welcome to Augmental Reality Frame! This project combines the power of A-Frame and MindAR to create an interactive augmented reality experience.

  

## Overview

  

Augmental Reality Frame is a web-based augmented reality (AR) application that allows users to interact with virtual content overlaid on the real world through their devices. It leverages the A-Frame framework for building immersive VR experiences and integrates MindAR for image tracking and recognition.

  

## Features

  

- **Image Recognition:** The application uses MindAR to recognize predefined images, triggering augmented reality content.

  

- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can navigate through a portfolio of AR content by interacting with the virtual interface.

  

- **Image Carousel:** The AR content includes a carousel of images that users can cycle through using navigation icons.

  

- **Clickable Content:** Images in the portfolio are clickable, allowing users to explore additional information or links related to each image.
